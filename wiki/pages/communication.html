            <h1>7 An interview with the insurance consultant</h1>
            <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5283/communication-img/c7-2.webp" alt="com-7">
            <p>In order to deeply explore the current social medical security system faced by diabetes patients in China and its actual operation, the AFMU-China team carefully planned and implemented a targeted interview activity, the interview target is
                the professional in charge of claims settlement of the Langfang branch of Taiping Life Insurance Co., LTD. Through in-depth interviews, we were able to gain a detailed understanding of the healthcare challenges faced by people with diabetes
                and the different steps they may take in the insurance claims process from the perspective of front-line workers.</p>
            <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5283/communication-img/c7-1.webp" alt="com-7">
            <p>In the domestic medical insurance system, the insurance policy for diabetic patients sets different reimbursement standards and compensation ratios according to the severity of the disease and complications. For patients diagnosed with diabetes,
                the medical insurance will cover part of the cost of drugs, especially for basic hypoglycemic drugs and related drugs for the treatment of some complications. For patients who use more expensive imported drugs or require long-term insulin
                therapy, insurance may not be able to fully cover the full cost, where commercial insurance plays an important role.</p>
            <p>In commercial insurance companies such as Langfang Central Branch of Taiping Life Insurance Co., LTD., there are a wide variety of protection products for diabetic patients, including but not limited to specific disease insurance, hospitalization
                medical insurance and chronic disease management services. When buying a specific disease insurance for diabetic patients, once a specific type of diabetic complication is diagnosed (such as diabetic foot, diabetic kidney disease, etc.),
                the insurance company will provide additional compensation according to the contract. For inpatient medical insurance, as long as the medical expenses incurred by the hospitalization of diabetic patients due to diabetes-related complications
                reach the minimum payment line, the insurance company will reimburse the hospitalization expenses in accordance with the proportion agreed on in the contract.</p>
            <p>Society's attention and help for diabetes patients are increasing day by day, and the prospect is broad. However, how to further improve the level of medical insurance treatment, optimize insurance products and services, and reduce the burden
                of patients is still a problem to be solved. To this end, industry experts call on the government, medical institutions, pharmaceutical companies and all sectors of society to work together to create a more friendly medical environment
                for diabetes patients.</p>

            <h2>FIST engineering lactic acid bacteria product comprehensive analysis report</h2>
            <h3>1.Geographical adaptability of products</h3>
            <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5283/communication-img/c10-1.webp" alt="com-8">
            <p>FIST's investigation of engineered lactic acid bacteria products covers Shandong, Fujian, Sichuan, Henan, Liaoning and other provinces, showing that the product has a wide range of geographical adaptability. This shows that the product can
                be effectively used in different geographical environments to meet the needs of consumers in different regions.</p>
            <h3>2. User feedback and satisfaction</h3>
            <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5283/communication-img/c10-2.webp" alt="com-8">
            <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5283/communication-img/c10-3.webp" alt="com-8">
            <p>Post-use satisfaction Most users have a high overall satisfaction with the product. For example, users 27 and 92 both said they were "very satisfied," and although there were individual users (such as user 53) who said they were "very dissatisfied,"
                the overall feedback was positive.</p>

            <h3>3. Changes in blood sugar levels</h3>

            <h1>9 Charity groups act together</h1>
            <p>"Joining Hands in Philanthropy: Our Charitable Endeavors and Social Contributions"</p>

            <p>As we ventured deeper into the diabetes clinic for our field visit, a heartrending panorama unfolded before our eyes, touching even the most resilient hearts.</p>
            <p>In the dawn's early light, we encountered elderly figures shuffling along the path, each step laden with the weight of years and the struggles against illness. Their worn-out bags, perhaps the only possessions they carried, spoke of the simplicity
                and hardship of their lives. Their hunched backs, etched by time and countless battles with disease, served as testament to their resilience. Their dark, lined faces betrayed a mix of anxiety for the future and the heavy burden of both
                physical and financial strife.</p>
            <p>We halted to engage with these seniors, and in their trembling voices, we heard stories of unwavering resilience, love for family, and a yearning for a healthier life. These encounters profoundly moved us, igniting a sense of urgency to take
                action – to do something tangible to bring comfort to these souls shivering in the cold and light up their journey ahead.</p>
            <p> We envision channeling every penny our team earns, through the esteemed Xi'an Charity Federation, to those who are most in need of our assistance. We are convinced that each donation will transform into a powerful force of warmth, instilling
                hope and brightness into their lives.</p>
             <iframe src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5283/pdf/ngo.pdf"></iframe>
            <p>Furthermore, we aim to collaborate with affiliated hospitals to organize regular free clinics, where professional medical teams will provide consultations and examinations. </p>

            <p>This is a weighty responsibility, but also a noble mission. We are cognizant of the challenges ahead, yet we are unwavering in our belief that, with hearts full of love and united efforts, we can create a shelter for those in need, nurturing
                seeds of hope and love that will blossom into radiant flowers.</p>
            <p>In order to realize this plan, we have forged a close partnership with the Zhang Hua Volunteer Service Team of the Air Force Medical University, collaborating intimately in their 2024 Clothing Donation Campaign, delivering warmth and care
                to those in need. Concurrently, we engaged in profound exchanges with the Philanthropy Association of Xi'an City and the Xi'an Branch of Rongtong Group, which not only broadened our charitable network but also laid a solid foundation for
                our subsequent philanthropic endeavors.</p>
            <p> These activities not only directly benefited vulnerable groups such as elderly diabetic patients but also disseminated positive energy throughout society, inspiring more people to embrace kindness and benevolent actions.</p>

            <p>Every step we take embodies our profound respect for life and compassion for the less fortunate. We firmly believe that through sustained efforts and unwavering dedication, we can coalesce into a formidable social force, contributing our share
                towards building a more harmonious and compassionate society.</p>
