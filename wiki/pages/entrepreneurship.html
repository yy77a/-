                            <div class="hidden-content">
                            <p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease caused by insufficient insulin secretion or action dysfunction, mainly characterized by persistent increases in blood glucose levels. Depending on the etiology and clinical manifestations,
                                diabetes can be divided into multiple types, with the most common being type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is even more common, and occurs mainly in adults, especially in middle-aged and older people.
                                Its pathogenesis is complex, involving many factors such as genetics, environment and lifestyle. Insulin secretion may be normal or slightly higher, but the effect of insulin is reduced, that is, insulin resistance. As
                                the disease develops, the function of islet β -cells gradually declines, insulin secretion decreases, and blood glucose levels further increase.</p>

                            <p>The effects of diabetes on the body are multifaceted. Long-term hyperglycemia can cause damage to multiple organs and systems throughout the body, including the cardiovascular system, nervous system, kidneys, eyes, etc. Cardiovascular
                                disease is one of the most common complications in patients with diabetes, including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke and so on. In addition, diabetes can also lead to neuropathy, such as peripheral
                                neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy, with symptoms of limb numbness, pain, paresthesia and so on. Diabetic nephropathy is one of the serious complications of diabetes, which can lead to renal failure and uremia. Diabetic
                                retinopathy may lead to visual loss or even blindness. Blood sugar regulation function disorder can directly affect the body function, which lead to the decline of systemic health level, and diabetes complications can cause
                                a series of physiological and psychological symptoms (figure 1), lead to social embarrassment, depression and anxiety, seriously disturb the patients career and social life.</p>

                                such as long-term use of drugs such as glucocorticoids. At present, there is still a lack of effective treatment means in clinical practice, and insulin injection and hypoglycemic drugs are still used as the main treatment
                                means. However, long-term insulin injection will cause adverse reactions such as hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal discomfort in patients. Therefore, the use of non-invasive and low side effects is a more ideal treatment

                                have not achieved good results. Therefore, it is urgent to find a treatment that can effectively control blood glucose to improve the quality of life and physical and mental health of diabetic patients.</p>

                            <div class="hidden-content">
                            <p>The closed-loop insulin delivery system, also known as the artificial pancreas system, combines an insulin pump with a continuous blood glucose monitor to form a feedback loop. These systems can automatically adjust insulin
                                administration according to real-time blood glucose levels, reducing the burden of diabetes management and improving overall glycemic control. As a product of modern medical technology, insulin pump provides more convenient
                                and accurate insulin delivery methods for many patients with diabetes, and improves the quality of life of patients. At the same time, the closed-loop insulin delivery system can simulate the physiological function of the
                                human pancreas, and automatically adjust the insulin injection dose according to the blood sugar level of the patient, realizing the precise control of blood sugar, and reducing the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
                                This intelligent management method not only reduces the burden of patients, but also improves the treatment effect.</p>

                            <p>However, this innovative therapy also faces some challenges, most notably its high price and the inconvenience to carry in vitro. Medtronics MiniMed 780G and Tandems Control-IQ are typical examples of such systems. In terms
                                of the price, the insulin pump is obviously more expensive than the traditional insulin injection method. This is undoubtedly a heavy burden for many patients with limited economic conditions. Therefore, how to make more
                                patients can afford the treatment cost has become an urgent problem to be solved. On the other hand, the insulin pump needs to be carried in vitro and invasive, which limits the freedom of movement to some extent, and causes
                                a certain psychological burden on the patient. For patients who need to go out frequently or do strenuous exercise, this is undoubtedly a big problem. Moreover, in vitro carriage increases the risk of lost or damaged equipment,
                                further increasing the financial and psychological stress of patients. Solving relevant core technologies and producing accurate internal blood glucose monitoring with independent intellectual property rights can greatly
                                reduce the cost of diabetes treatment and improve the treatment effect, benefiting the majority of diabetic patients in China.</p>

                            <p>In conclusion, the closed-loop insulin delivery system therapy can stimulate insulin secretion and fundamentally solve the diabetes complications, systemic and mental health problems caused by insufficient insulin secretion.
                                The clinical application of this technology has been recognized by most professionals and patients. However, at present, there is still a lack of internal monitoring of blood sugar and precise drug administration in the
                                domestic market, and it is urgent to conquer relevant core technologies and produce related products.</p>

                            in the form of amino acids. Moreover, due to the limitation of intestinal polyproteases (such as trypsin), pH and other special environmental factors, the reliability, safety and efficiency of intestinal delivery proteins have
                            always been a difficult problem. Through the integrated design of FGF21 and the CPP fusion protein mediating the intestinal epithelial transcytosis protein, we not only improved the overall stability of the fusion protein,
                            but also this clathrin-mediated targeted transcytosis is more safe and reliable than the previous "intestinal transit" strategy that destroyed the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier.</p>

                            <h4>(2) Constitutive membrane surface display of the P9-Anchor-SP module</h4> 
                            <p>It is far from enough for patients with type II diabetes to regulate blood glucose only after meals due to insulin resistance, and their
                            elevated baseline level of blood glucose will also lead to a series of target organ damage. So we further designed the system for constitutive expression and displaying P9 protein on the membrane surface as a supplement to
                            the hypoglycemic effect of FGF21. Under normal circumstances, most intestinal probiotics cannot no direct contact with intestinal epithelial cells due to the presence of the intestinal mucus layer. In diabetic patients, the
                            intestinal mucus barrier becomes thin and it is damaged, which provides a theoretical basis for the interaction between the surface display protein of our lactobacillus membrane and intestinal cells. And the efficiency of constitutive
                            expression protein in lactic acid bacteria is much lower than inducible expression, but due to the design of membrane display mode, constitutive expression of P9 protein can be continuously anchored to the membrane surface,
                            to ensure the surface of lactobacillus also has a higher number of P9 protein and increased contact with intestinal L cell ICAM-2 receptor. The system also deacts after the improvement of intestinal mucosal status in diabetic
                            patients due to the particularity of the parasitic site of lactic acid bacteria.</p>

                        <h4>(1)At present, Chinas national consumption level is rising steadily, and the social economy is stable and upward</h4>
                        <p>China has maintained overall economic and social stability, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In response to the impact of more than expected factors such as the repeated delay of the epidemic and the outbreak of
                            the Ukraine crisis, we resolutely stepped up the implementation of macro policies, focused on stabilizing growth, stabilizing employment and stabilizing prices, and promoting the stabilization and recovery of the economy. In
                            2022, the GDP will reach 121 trillion yuan, up 3.0%; 12.06 million, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate is 5.5% at the end of the year; The overall price level continues to run smoothly, and the consumer price index (CPI)
                            keeps below 3%, in sharp contrast to the global inflation level reaching a new high of more than 40 years.</p>
                        <h4>(2)The state promotes the expansion and sinking of quality medical care and expands the medical market</h4>
                        <p>The Ministry of Finance issued a report on the implementation of the central and local budgets for 2022 and the draft central and local budgets for 2023. The report points out that the improvement of medical and health service
                            capacity should be supported in 2023. A total of 170 billion yuan will be allocated through general transfer payments, and 30 billion yuan will be carried forward from the accrual basis in 2022 to support local governments
                            in epidemic prevention and control, with the focus on county-level governments. It is worth noting that the era when the middle and low-end equipment can dominate the county market only with the advantage of low price has passed.
                            When the current attention of county medical treatment has been greatly increased, the county hospitals demand for high-end medical equipment and the requirements for product performance are also there.</p>

                        <p>It can be seen that the new medical devices have a broader demand in the industry.</p>

                        <h3 class="toggle-text" onclick="toggleNextContent(this)">6.2.3 Main function strategy<sub><font color="blue">+</font></sub></h3>
                        <div class="hidden-content">
                        <p>The company functional strategy is to ensure the efficient coordination of all departments of the company in the operation process, and the reasonable allocation of resources, so as to support the company to achieve long-term success
                            and stable development in the market competition. The effective operation and cooperation of various functional departments is the key to achieving the company strategic goals, so it is crucial to develop a clear functional
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>First, the cooperation between the R & D department and the production department is the top priority in the functional strategy. The R & D department is responsible for the design and innovation of the products, while the production
                            department is responsible for converting these designs into marketable goods. To ensure that products are timely and efficient, functional strategies should include seamless integration between research and development and
                            production processes, reducing the time from design to mass production. By establishing a feedback mechanism between R & D and production, we can solve possible design problems in production in time to ensure that the quality
                            of products is consistent with innovation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the quality management department also plays a central role in the company functional strategy. High-quality products are the key to the company competitive advantage, and the quality management department passes through
                            a strict quality control system to ensure that the products meet the market demand and the standards of laws and regulations. The functional strategy should include the continuous optimization of quality control, especially
                            the introduction of more automated testing means in the production process to improve the detection efficiency and reduce the possible errors caused by human factors.</p>
                        <p>The sales department and the customer service department, as the window of the company to contact with the outside world, shoulder the responsibility of building the company brand image and improving customer satisfaction. The
                            functional strategy should emphasize the close cooperation between the sales department and the customer service department, and maintain the long-term cooperation relationship between the company and the customers through
                            precise market positioning and timely after-sales service. Especially in expanding the market, the market development strategy of the sales department should be complemented with the after-sales support of the customer service
                            department to ensure that the whole customer experience from purchase to use reaches a high standard.</p>
                        <p>The functional strategy of the finance department focuses on optimizing the company resource allocation and cost control. With reasonable capital geting and monitoring, the company is able to expand its business while remaining
                            financially sound. The finance department should work closely with various departments to ensure that the allocation of funds is consistent with the company strategic objectives. For the long-term development of the company,
                            the financial department also needs to assume the responsibility of capital risk management, and prevent unnecessary financial losses through risk assessment and prediction.</p>
                        <p>The role of the human resources department in the functional strategy is reflected in the cultivation of talents and the establishment of the incentive mechanism. By constantly attracting and retaining high-quality talents, the
                            company promotes technological innovation and business development. At the same time, the functional strategy should include a sound employee training system to help employees improve their skills and adapt to the rapid development
                            of the company business. Through scientific performance appraisal and a reasonable salary system, the human resources department can motivate employees to maximize their potential and contribute to the growth of the company.</p>
                        <p>The functional strategy of the administrative department should focus on improving the internal management efficiency of the company and ensuring the good operation of the office environment. The administrative department is responsible
                            for the company daily affairs and logistics management, to ensure the communication and coordination between various departments. The functional strategy should include optimizing administrative processes, reducing unnecessary
                            red tape, and improving the overall operational efficiency of the company.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the role of the legal compliance department in the functional strategy is crucial. With the expansion of the company business and the rapid development of technology, compliance and legal risk management are particularly
                            important. The functional strategy should include the formulation of a sound legal risk prevention mechanism to ensure that the company can strictly follow relevant laws and regulations in technological innovation and market
                            expansion to avoid potential risks caused by legal problems.</p>

                        <div class="hidden-content">
                        <h2>10.1 Capital exit method</h2>
                        <p>Our company can support the following three ways to complete the capital exit: bidding transfer —— share public listing (IPO), contractual transfer —— sale or repurchase, and forced transfer —— bankruptcy liquidation.</p>
                        <h4>(1) Share Public Listing (IPO)</h4>
                        <p>That is, the initial public offering of shares refers to the listing of the enterprise in the securities market, which is a win-win situation for the enterprise itself or the investors. After the IPO of an enterprise, the equity held by the investment institution may increase ten or dozens of times, and selling its shares in time can obtain high returns. For enterprises, in addition to the value added of the stocks held by enterprises, more important is the recognition of good business performance in the capital market, which can enable enterprises to obtain funds for further development in the securities market.</p>
                        <h4>(2) Sale or repurchase</h4>
                        <p>Share sale is an exit channel through which a general company or another venture capital company can acquire or merges the shares held by a venture capital firm or venture capitalists at the negotiated price. Share repurchase refers to the purchase of shares by a venture enterprise or venture entrepreneur. Investors can realize their own equity of investment projects at any time to maximize the returns of venture capital companies. And the operation is relatively simple to IPO, the cost is low, can achieve one-time withdrawal and suitable for various types of companies. It can also be used as a tool for venture capital enterprises to avoid risk.</p>
                        <h4>(3) Bankruptcy and liquidation</h4>
                        <p>There are various uncertainties in the operation of the enterprise. For the venture capital of the confirmed project failure, we will adopt the liquidation method as soon as possible to recover as much residual capital as possible. It is the best exit way to reduce the loss when the venture investment is unsuccessful. Of course, if the failed investment project has no other debt, or although there is a small amount of other debt, but the creditors do not investigate, then other methods can be adopted to operate, and through the negotiation of determining the distribution of the residual value of the enterprise.</p>
                        <h2>10.2 Time of capital withdrawal</h2>
                        <p>Timing is very important. The timing is appropriate, and the venture capital can obtain greater returns. The enterprise will be based on the merits of the investment environment and their own development status, specific problems
                            specific analysis.
                        </p>
                        <h4>(1) Capital recovery</h4>
                        <p>If the company operating conditions become worse, it will merge and reorganize with other competitive companies.</p>
                        <h4>(2) Asset sale</h4>
                        <p>If the enterprise operates improperly and makes less profit, part of the assets sold will maintain normal operation; The Company will also consider selling some assets to expand market competitiveness and seize market opportunities for new project development, development and innovation to promote the sustainable development and growth of the Company.</p>
                        <h4>(3) Bankruptcy liquidation</h4>
                        <p>Once the enterprise is confirmed to lose the possibility of development or grow too slow, it will file for bankruptcy liquidation. We will try to minimize the loss of venture capital projects and guarantee the maximum economic interests of investors.</p>
                        <h4>(4) Sale of equity to a third party</h4>
                        <p>If the company encounters significant financial risks, it can sell part of the equity to ensure the maximization of interests, and the equity transfer can be completed through the acquisition and merger departments of professional institutions such as investment banks and securities companies. At present, China has established sound property rights trading institutions and systems in major cities such as Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai and other places. Using this effective operation platform, the company can be listed to transfer the equity to make the venture capital exit smoothly.</p>
