            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a serious chronic metabolic disease with a large number of patients worldwide. The current treatment methods mainly include insulin injection and oral hypoglycemic drugs. The existing treatments have some limitations,
                such as the need for frequent administration and the possibility of side effects such as hypoglycemia. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to develop a more effective and safer drug for the treatment of diabetes. Our team's
                goal is to develop a novel glucose-lowering Lactobacillus based on synthetic biology, which can effectively regulate blood glucose level, reduce side effects, and improve the quality of life of patients by releasing fibroblast growth factor
                21 and P9 proteins. Using genetic engineering technology, the new lactic acid bacteria will design and construct specific biological systems, and eventually synthesize edible yogurt. To achieve long-term therapeutic effects on diabetes.</p>

            <h1>Design validation experiments for gut piercing peptides</h1>
            <p>In the future, the team will design validation experiments for the perforin peptide. Intestinal perforin peptides can carry bioactive molecules secreted by synthetic lactic acid bacteria across the intestinal barrier and enter the blood circulation
                or tissues and organs. The integrated biomimetic array (iBAC) human small intestine model will be constructed to study the intestinal transit efficiency and therapeutic effect of perforin peptide coated FGF21 and P9. At the same time,
                ELISA and other detection kits were used to detect the concentration of perforin in tissues to quantitatively analyze its penetration effect and penetration rate. The effectiveness of perforating peptides was verified by experiments to
                provide a basis for the development of lactic acid bacteria delivery system, improve the bioavailability of products, reduce side effects, and improve the therapeutic effect.</p>

            <h1>Bacteria Delivery</h1>
            <h2>Question 1: What are the specific methods of bacterial encapsulation and delivery?</h2>
            <h3>Specific methods of bacterial encapsulation and delivery include:</h3>
            <h4>Microencapsulation:</h4>
            <p>Defined as surface modification of individual bacteria, achieved through nanomembranes or surface decoration.</p>
            <p>Example: Utilizing microencapsulation techniques to enhance the in vivo survival rate of engineered bacteria, resisting the acidic environment of the gastrointestinal tract, and avoiding clearance by the immune system(Lyu et al., 2024).</p>
            <h4>Macroencapsulation:</h4>
            <p>Exploiting materials and devices ranging from millimeters to centimeters in size to encapsulate groups of bacteria, offering advantages such as extended in vivo lifespan, enhanced immunoisolation, and integration with wireless electronic technology.</p>
            <p>Example: Employing hydrogel matrices, microneedles, and capsules as carriers for macroencapsulated bacteria, assisting in bacterial therapy through oral administration and other delivery routes.(Lyu et al., 2024).</p>
            <h4>Genetic Editing:</h4>
            <p>Enhancing the activity and adhesion of bacteria within the body through genetic editing.</p>
            <p>Example: Controlling the mucus-binding properties of probiotics by heterologously expressing or altering surface proteins and cellular components.(Lyu et al., 2024)</p>
            <h4>Commensal Bacteria and Bacterial Interactions:</h4>
            <p>Selecting strains that already reside within the host as the starting bacterial strains to enhance the engraftment of engineered bacteria.</p>
            <p>Example: Designing a commensal <span class="italic">E. coli</span> strain for mice that can maintain the ability to respond to inflammation in the mouse gut for at least six months(Lyu et al., 2024).</p>
            <h4>Synthetic Engraftment by Macroencapsulation:</h4>
            <p>Achieving "synthetic engraftment" of engineered bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract through diversified methods such as mechanical immobilization and magnetic field control.</p>
            <p>Example: Using magnetic hydrogels and wearable magnets to achieve intestinal localization, retention, and diagnosis.(Lyu et al,. 2024)</p>

            <h5>Figure 1. Overview of encapsulation uses.(Klojdová et al,. 2023)</h5>

            <h2>Question 2: How can we safely and effectively deliver probiotics while reducing the medication burden on diabetic patients?</h2>
            <p>In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, we have employed an innovative microencapsulation technique to enhance the delivery efficiency and viability of probiotics within the human body. This technology encapsulates probiotics within protective microcapsules, enabling them to withstand the corrosive effects of stomach acid and digestive enzymes, safely reaching the intestines to exert their function. The probiotic we selected is <span class="italic">L.lactis</span>, which is not only beneficial to human health but has also been demonstrated to survive and provide therapeutic effects within the gut(Klojdová et al,. 2023).</p>
            <p>The microcapsules are made from sodium alginate, a biocompatible material that remains stable in the acidic environment of the stomach and rapidly releases probiotics in the neutral environment of the small intestine. This pH-sensitive release mechanism ensures that the probiotics are released at the optimal location and time, thereby maximizing their therapeutic effect on type 2 diabetes(Lyu et al,. 2024).</p>
            <p>To improve patient acceptance and compliance, we have combined the microencapsulated probiotics with yogurt. As a widely accepted food, yogurt not only provides an ideal environment for the growth and survival of probiotics but also, with its natural sweetness and cold food characteristics, makes the treatment more palatable for patients. Compared to traditional drug therapies, this method of delivering probiotics through daily diet is more natural and convenient, helping to reduce the psychological burden on patients.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, our delivery strategy allows patients to manage their health conditions through simple dietary changes without relying on complex drug intake or medical procedures. This approach not only enhances treatment compliance but may also improve patients' overall quality of life, as it offers a more natural and intuitive way to manage type 2 diabetes.</p>
            <p>In summary, the application of microencapsulation technology ensures the effective delivery and activity of probiotics and, by integrating treatment into daily diet, improves patient acceptance and compliance. This method provides a safe, effective, and user-friendly alternative therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <h5>Figure 2. The function of microencapsulation(Lyu et al., 2024)</h5>

            <h2>Question 3: Can targeted delivery to the small intestine be achieved?</h2>
            <p>Targeted delivery of <span class="italic">L.lactis</span> was achieved by encapsulating it in pH-sensitive sodium alginate microspheres that are targeted to the small intestine. Specifically, the sodium alginate microspheres exhibit pH responsiveness; when the environmental pH is lower than the pKa of sodium alginate, the -COO- groups gain protons to form -COOH, resulting in the formation of a solid hydrogel that encapsulates <span class="italic">L.lactis</span>. As the pH increases, the electrostatic repulsion between -COO- groups causes the hydrogel to swell, leading to the disruption of the hydrogel and the release of <span class="italic">L.lactis</span>. Furthermore, the application of a chitosan shell and small intestine-targeting antibody proton-dependent transporter 1 (PepT1) on the outer surface of the sodium alginate microspheres enables the microspheres to adhere more effectively to the intestinal wall and assists the microsystem in better targeting the small intestine. This approach achieves targeted delivery of <span class="italic">L.lactis</span> and enhances its colonization efficiency in the small intestine(Pan H et al., 2022).</p>
                <h3>Targeting delivery strategies to intestinal crypt enterocytes:</h3>
                <h4>Molecular targeting recognition:</h4>
                <p>Cells in the intestinal crypts, such as enterocytes, often express specific markers. For instance, intestinal stem cells frequently exhibit Lgr5, Bmi1, and CD133, while Paneth cells may express SOX9(Barker et al., 2007), among others. The L cell, a type of endocrine cell in the gut, primarily secretes glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The surface of L cells often expresses specific markers, including the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)(Drucker et al., 2006). Therefore, we can utilize protein engineering and chemical synthesis techniques to design ligands (such as peptide sequences, nucleic acid aptamers) or antibodies that can specifically bind to these markers. pH-sensitive PLGA nanoparticles are designed using PLGA-PEG copolymers containing pH-sensitive linkages, preparing nanoparticles that disassemble under acidic conditions. Subsequently, chemical conjugation (such as EDC/NHS coupling) is used to covalently attach targeting ligands or antibodies to the surface of the nanocarriers or microspheres. This modification allows for specific recognition and binding to GLP-1R, TH-expressing L cells in the intestinal crypts, facilitating drug release in the acidic environment, such as the slightly acidic surroundings of the intestinal crypts.</p>
