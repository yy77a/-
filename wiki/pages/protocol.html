            <p>Temperature-controlled water bath or room temperature conditions</p>
            <h3>Experimental Procedure:</h3>
            <h4>1. Preparation of Culture Medium:</h4>
            <p>Weigh yeast extract, peptone, and NaCl according to the formula of MSR medium and dissolve in distilled water.</p>
            <p>Adjust the pH to 7.0.</p>
            <p>If necessary, add an appropriate amount of Ampicillin (e.g., 100 µg/mL).</p>
            <p>Dispense the medium into sterile Erlenmeyer flasks or test tubes, leaving space for shaking culture.</p>
            <h4>2. Strain Revival:</h4>
            <p>Retrieve the stored E. coli strain from the -80°C freezer.</p>
            <p>Revive the strain in a 37°C water bath.</p>
            <p>Under sterile conditions, inoculate the revived strain into MSR medium and incubate overnight in a shaking incubator at 37°C.</p>
            <h4>3. Seed Culture:</h4>
            <p>Take 100 µL of the overnight culture and add it to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of MSR medium.</p>
            <p>Cultivate at 37°C and 200 rpm until the OD600 reaches 0.5-0.7 (approximately 3-4 hours).</p>
            <h4>4. Preparation of Inducer:</h4>
            <p>Prepare a 1 M stock solution of IPTG powder and dilute to the working concentration with an appropriate amount of distilled water before use.</p>
            <h4>5. Induction of Expression:</h4>
            <p>When the OD600 reaches 0.5-0.7, add IPTG to the medium to a final concentration of 0.1-1 mM.</p>
            <p>Different IPTG concentrations and induction times can be set according to the experimental design.</p>
            <h4>6. *nduction Cultivation:</h4>
            <p>After induction, place the medium back into the shaking incubator at 37°C for continued cultivation.</p>
            <p>The induction time can be several hours or overnight (approximately 16-24 hours).</p>
            <h4>7. Cell Collection:</h4>
            <p>After the induction is complete, remove the medium and centrifuge at 4°C at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>Collect the bacterial pellet, remove the supernatant, and the pellet can be used for subsequent protein extraction.</p>
            <h3>Precautions:</h3>
            <P>All operations should be performed under sterile conditions to avoid contamination by miscellaneous bacteria.</P>
            <p>The working solution of IPTG should be freshly prepared and stored at -20°C.</p>
            <p> The induction time and IPTG concentration need to be optimized according to the target protein.</p>
            <p>The induction temperature may affect protein expression and folding; lower temperatures (e.g., 16°C) generally help to improve solubility and reduce the formation of inclusion bodies.</p>

            <p>1. To assess the insulin resistance improvement effects of FGF21， RAW‐CM containing vehicle, 200 μg/ml or 2000 μg/ml proteins were added into 3T3‐L1 adipocytes.</p>
            <p>2. After treatment for 24 h, 1 nM insulin was added to activate the insulin‐induced PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. </p>
            <p>3. The insulin sensitivity was detected by the AKT (Ser473) phosphorylation, which was qualified using western blotting.</p>
            <h2>Total Protein Extraction and Western Blot Validation of Pathway Protein Changes</h2>
            <h3>Cell lysis</h3>
            <p>Cells are washed with cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer. The volume of RIPA added is 1000 μL per 100 mg of tissue (approximately 200 μL for a 6-well plate). PMSF is added at a ratio of 1001:1 when used. The mixture should
                be agitated until PMSF is no longer crystalline before mixing with the lysate.</p>
            <h3>Protein collection</h3>
            <p>The cell lysate is transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 4°C, 12000 RPM for 10 minutes. The supernatant, containing the total protein, is collected in a fresh 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, avoiding the pellet.</p>
            <b>Determination of protein concentration</b>
            <p>The BCA protein assay kit is used to determine protein concentration according to the kit manual.</p>
            <h2>Western Blot (WB) analysis</h2>
            <h3>SDS-PAGE electrophoresis</h3>
            <p>Protein denaturation is performed by mixing the protein sample with loading buffer and heating at 100°C for 10 minutes. The denatured protein is then cooled and stored at room temperature before use.</p>
            <h3>Gel preparation</h3>
            <p>The gel apparatus is assembled and checked for leaks. The appropriate concentration of separating gel is chosen based on the size of the protein to be run.</p>
            <h3>Electrophoresis</h3>
            <p>The protein samples are loaded onto the SDS-PAGE gel, and electrophoresis is performed with the Concentrating Gel at 80V and Separating Gel at 100V.</p>
            <h3>Transfer</h3>
            <p>The gel is removed, and the transfer membrane device is assembled with a filter paper-glue-film-filter paper sandwich structure. Pre-cooled electrotransfer solution is added, and the transfer is performed at 220 mA, 4°C for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
            <h3>Blocking</h3>
            <p>The membrane is blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder for 1.5 hours at room temperature to minimize nonspecific binding.</p>
            <h3>Antibody incubation</h3>
            <p>The membrane is incubated with the primary (target) antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by three washes with TBST (TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 8 to 10 minutes each.</p>
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>After discarding the secondary antibody solution and washing the membrane three times with TBST for 10 minutes each, the membrane is placed in chemiluminescence imaging and mixed with the ECL luminescent fluid. The instrument is then operated
                for luminescence development.</p>
            <h2>Glucose uptake measurement:</h2>
            <h3>Cell culture and treatment</h3>
            <p>Cells are seeded in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment.</p>
            <p>When the cell reaches a proper convergence degree (70-80%), it is processed for the experiment.</p>
            <h3>Cell starvation treatment</h3>
            <p>Cells are starved for 12-24 hours prior to the experiment by changing to serum-free or low-serum medium such as 0.5% FBS to reduce basal glucose uptake.</p>
            <h3>Determination of glucose uptake</h3>
            <p>Prepare no glucose medium and containing 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) without glucose medium (such as 2-DG concentration of 1 mM).</p>
            <p>Cells are gently washed twice with preheated PBS to remove glucose from the residual medium.</p>
            <p>Add an appropriate amount of glucose-free medium containing 2-DG to each well (such as 0.5 mL per well).</p>
            <p>Incubate the cells at 37°C for the indicated time (e.g., 30 minutes).</p>
            <h3>To terminate the reaction</h3>
            <p>Cells are quickly washed twice with ice-cold PBS to terminate the glucose uptake reaction.</p>
            <p>To each well, add 0.5 mL of cold acid ethanol (75% ethanol + 1N HCl), and incubate on ice for 10 minutes.</p>
            <h3>Cell lysis</h3>
            <p>Transfer the cell lysate solution to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 4°C under 13000 RPM for 10 minutes.</p>

            <h1>VII. GLP-1 Secretion Experiment</h1>
            <h2>NCI-H716 Cell Culture and Co-culture</h2>
            <h3>Cell Preparation</h3>
            <p>1. Culture the NCI-H716 cell line in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) to maintain cell growth and health. (For cell culture in 96-well plates, the volume of medium added per
                well is typically between 100 to 200 microliters (μl)).</p>
            <p>2. Seed the cells in collagen-coated 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 10^5 cells/ml and incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to ensure cell adhesion.</p>

            <p>Note: Hemolysis of specimens can affect the final test results, therefore hemolyzed specimens should not be used for this test.</p>
            <h3>Reagent Preparation</h3>
            <p>Working Solution of Wash Liquid:Dilute concentrated wash liquid by 1:20 with deionized water. For example, measure 285ml of deionized water into a volumetric flask or other clean container, then measure 15ml of concentrated wash liquid and
                add it evenly, stirring to mix well, prepare just before use. Concentrated wash liquid may precipitate salts when stored at low temperatures, and warming in a water bath can help dissolve during dilution.</p>
            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            <p>1. Before starting the experiment, please prepare all reagents in advance. When diluting reagents or samples, they must be mixed evenly, and try to avoid foaming when mixing.</p>
            <p>2. When using the reagent kit for the first time, centrifuge various reagent tubes for a few minutes to concentrate the liquid on the cap and walls of the tube to the bottom.</p>
            <h3>Operating Procedures</h3>
            <p>1. Bring all reagents to room temperature (18-25°C) and let them equilibrate for at least 30 minutes, prepare reagents as described above, and have them ready for use.</p>
            <p>2. Take out the enzyme-linked plate, set up one blank control well without adding any liquid; for each standard point, set up two wells in sequence, adding the corresponding standard 50μl to each well; for the remaining detection wells, directly
                add the test specimen 50μl.</p>
            <p>3. Add 50μl of enzyme conjugate to each well (except for the blank control well), mix well, apply a non-drying adhesive seal, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.</p>
            <p>4. Manually wash the plate, discard the liquid in the wells. Fill each well with wash liquid, let it sit for 10 seconds, then spin dry, repeat this process three times, and then pat dry; if using an automatic plate washer, select the wash
                three times program, and pat dry after washing.</p>
            <p>5. Add 50μl of substrate solution A and 50μl of substrate solution B to each well, mix well, and incubate at 37°C in the dark for 15 minutes, then add 50μl of stop solution to each well.</p>
            <p>6. Measure the optical density (OD value) of each well at 450nm wavelength with a microplate reader. Perform the test within 10 minutes after the reaction is terminated.</p>
            <h3>Operating Points</h3>
            <p>1. To ensure the accuracy of the test results, it is recommended to set up double wells for both standards and samples. A standard curve should be made for each test.</p>
            <p>2. If the content of the test substance in the specimen is too high, please dilute with an appropriate solution first to make the sample fit within the detection range of the reagent kit, and then multiply by the corresponding dilution factor
                for the final calculation.</p>
            <p>3. Pipetting: When pipetting, please use disposable clean tips to avoid cross-contamination. Pipetting should be as gentle as possible to avoid foaming, add the sample to the bottom of the enzyme-linked plate wells, and do not add along the
                well walls. It is best to control the pipetting time within 10 minutes, and if there are many samples, it is recommended to use a multi-channel pipette.</p>
            <p>4. Incubation: To prevent sample evaporation or contamination, the enzyme-linked plate must be covered with a plate seal during the incubation process, and the plate should not be in a dry state during the experiment. The temperature of the
                incubator should be monitored at any time to ensure it is constant at 37°C, and adjusted in time. The incubator should not be opened too many times during the incubation process to avoid affecting the temperature balance.</p>
            <p>5. Washing: The washing process is very important, and insufficient washing can easily lead to false positives.</p>
            <p>Manual washing method: Suck or spin off the liquid inside the enzyme-linked plate (do not touch the well walls and bottom); lay several layers of absorbent paper on the experimental table, place the plate face down and pat it hard a few times;
                inject the recommended wash buffer into the wells at 200μl/well, soak for 10 seconds. Repeat this process several times as described in the operating steps.</p>
            <p>Automatic washing: If an automatic plate washer is available, it should be used in the formal experimental process after becoming proficient in its use.</p>
            <p>6. Color development: To ensure the accuracy of the experimental results, the stop solution should be added as soon as possible after the substrate reaction time is up. You can observe the color development at intervals after adding the substrate
                solution to control the reaction time (for example, every 10 minutes). When the standard wells 3-4 in front are obviously gradient blue, and the last 3-4 wells are not obviously colored, you can add the stop solution to terminate the reaction,
                at which point the blue color will immediately turn yellow. The order of adding the stop solution should be as similar as possible to the order of adding the substrate solution.</p>
            <p>7. The substrate solution should be light blue or colorless, if the color turns dark, it must be discarded. The substrate solution is prone to contamination, please store it properly away from light.</p>
            <h3>Data Processing</h3>
            <p>Subtract the values of the standards and samples from the blank well values and plot the curve, if duplicate wells are set, their average values should be taken for calculation.</p>
            <p>With the concentration of the standards as the vertical coordinate (logarithmic scale) and the OD values as the horizontal coordinate (logarithmic scale), plot the standard curve on logarithmic coordinate paper.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to use professional curve-making software for analysis, which can be downloaded from our website "Curve Expert", and make the standard curve according to the prompts.</p>
            <p>Based on the OD value of the sample, find the corresponding concentration from the standard curve; or calculate the regression equation of the standard curve with the concentration and OD value of the standard, and then substitute the OD value
                of the sample into the equation to calculate the sample concentration.</p>
            <p>If the sample was diluted before testing, the final calculation should be multiplied by the corresponding dilution factor to obtain the actual concentration of the sample.</p>
